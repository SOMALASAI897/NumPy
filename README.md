# NumPy Project

This repository provides code and examples using **NumPy**, the fundamental package for numerical and scientific computing with Python. NumPy offers fast, memory-efficient operations on large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and includes a wide range of mathematical functions.

## Features

- Fast operations on multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- Mathematical routines for statistics, linear algebra, Fourier analysis, and more.
- Support for broadcasting and vectorized operations.
- Integration with other libraries such as SciPy and Pandas.

## Installation

Install NumPy via pip:
